該 Employee 表包含所有員工。每個員工都有一個Id，一個薪水，還有一個部門ID列。

    +----+-------+--------+--------------+
    | Id | Name  | Salary | DepartmentId |
    +----+-------+--------+--------------+
    | 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 1            |
    | 2  | Henry | 80000  | 2            |
    | 3  | Sam   | 60000  | 2            |
    | 4  | Max   | 90000  | 1            |
    +----+-------+--------+--------------+

該 Department 表包含公司的所有部門。

    +----+----------+
    | Id | Name     |
    +----+----------+
    | 1  | IT       |
    | 2  | Sales    |
    +----+----------+


編寫SQL查詢以查找每個部門中薪水最高的員工。對於上表，Max在IT部門的薪水最高，Henry在銷售部門的薪水最高。

    +------------+----------+--------+
    | Department | Employee | Salary |
    +------------+----------+--------+
    | IT         | Max      | 90000  |
    | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
    +------------+----------+--------+

# 答案

## 看回復的答案

```sql
SELECT
    Department.Name AS Department,
    Employee.Name AS Employee,
    Employee.Salary AS Salary
FROM
    (
        SELECT MAX(Salary) AS Salary, DepartmentId
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY DepartmentId
    ) AS Emp
    
    JOIN Department
    ON Department.Id = Emp.DepartmentId
    
    JOIN Employee
    ON Employee.Salary = Emp.Salary
    AND Employee.DepartmentId = Emp.DepartmentId
;
```

## 自己寫

```sql
SELECT a.Department , a.Employee, a.Salary
FROM
(
    SELECT  Department.Name as Department, Employee.Name as Employee, 
    MAX(Employee.Salary) as Salary
    FROM Employee
    inner JOIN Department ON Employee.DepartmentId = Department.Id
    Group BY Employee.DepartmentId  
) as a
ORDER BY a.Salary
;
```

結果不同，原因是 Group BY 時，僅有 Salary 動，變成以下

    +------------+----------+--------+
    | Department | Employee | Salary |
    +------------+----------+--------+
    | IT         | Joe      | 90000  |
    | Sales      | Henry    | 80000  |
    +------------+----------+--------+

Joe 因該是 Max，但並未更動，因此需跟Employee在JOIN或WHERE
